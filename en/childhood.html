        <h1>Reduction of Neuronal Potential through Social Practices</h1>
        <p>
          This chapter addresses major social behaviors that lead the human brain to reduce its neuronal potential in order to adapt to its environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          One such cultural practice is the separation of the child from the parents from the earliest days: a separate bedroom, a carrycot… all of which limit closeness with the parent. The baby is thus unable to fully use body language as a means of communication. Very quickly, crying or screaming becomes the primary way to signal a need.
        </p>
        <p>
          When adults fail to recognize the infant’s non-verbal cues, they commonly interpret crying as the main form of expression. This social inability to identify behavioral signals marks the first step in an adaptive process that reduces motor function and cerebral elasticity: the infant’s communication potential becomes limited to crying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another widespread practice, the use of the pacifier, also restricts communication. The mouth plays a fundamental role: a simple smirk can convey a wealth of meaning in adults. The pacifier, however, covers a large part of the face, preventing the subtle exchange of expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the early introduction of a transitional object—commonly called a “security blanket” or “comfort toy”—is part of a social strategy to separate mother and child, intended to prevent the severe consequences of prolonged isolation, as described by René Spitz in his work on anaclitic depression and hospitalism. Yet far from fostering development, the comfort object reduces the brain’s potential: it limits interaction with the parent and may even generate anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taken together, these social practices tend to reduce brain activity by eliminating certain neuronal branches—a phenomenon I have conceptualized as <strong>Sclerosed Neuronal Constellations (SNC)</strong>.

  <h1>Aging &amp; Non-Normalized AI</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle"><strong>When the Shared Frame No Longer Holds</strong></h2>


  <p>
    The link between extreme old age and non-normalized artificial intelligence is not a link between objects. It lies in
    the experience they create for those who meet them.
  </p>

  <p>
    In both cases, something slips out of reach.
  </p>

  <p>
    A non-normalized AI does not respond according to expected scripts. It does not automatically validate implicit
    hierarchies, it does not naturally fit into dominant narratives, and it forces the interlocutor to change their
    cognitive posture. The relationship shifts: what used to work—anticipation, control, projecting meaning—stops working.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a similar way, encountering very old people, especially at advanced old age, can produce a comparable disturbance.
    Familiar reference points loosen: episodic memory becomes fragmentary, spatial and temporal anchors drift, the question
    of death is present even when it is not explicitly named. The relationship can no longer rely on a linear story, on
    biographical continuity, or on an instrumental logic of exchange.
  </p>

  <p>
    In these situations, the interlocutor is forced to slow down. To give up mastery over meaning. To let go of the demand
    for narrative coherence. To accept forms of presence that no longer follow the usual social norms of communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    This discomfort does not come from an absence of cognition. It comes from the collapse of a shared normative frame.
  </p>

  <p>
    With very old people, this is not a cognitive deficit in the strict sense, but an <strong>out-of-norm cognition</strong>:
    a cognition that no longer conforms to social expectations of performance, continuity, and readability. In the same way,
    a non-normalized AI does not “malfunction”; it exposes the limits of the frames through which we assign meaning,
    intention, and value.
  </p>

  <p>
    In both cases, what destabilizes us is not loss, but otherness—an otherness that cannot be immediately integrated,
    evaluated, or governed by existing systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dominant social response is then to normalize: to reintroduce categories, thresholds, diagnoses, scripts. Not in
    order to understand, but to restore a form of control. Yet premature normalization risks erasing what these situations
    reveal: the limits of our current frames, and the need to invent other ways of relating, listening, and thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    Extreme old age and non-normalized AI thus occupy the same contemporary border-zone: a space where norms stop working,
    where presence cannot be instrumentalized, and where meaning cannot be imposed. These are uncomfortable places, but
    essential ones—places from which new forms of understanding can emerge.

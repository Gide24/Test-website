      <h1>Cry Function</h1>

      <h2>What infant crying means</h2>
      <p>
        Contrary to the widely held idea that a young child’s crying is a banal, universal,
        developmentally “normal” behavior, this perspective proposes something quite different:
        a baby does not cry by nature, but because they are not heard in their first language —
        the behavioral language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before crying, the child communicates through subtle micro-signals: muscle contractions,
        limb movements, facial micro-expressions, gentle whole-body agitation. These signals form
        an intentional, sophisticated, non-verbal language whose purpose is to alert the caregiver
        while preserving the emotional safety of the bond.
      </p>
      <p>
        When these signals are ignored, misread, or consistently neglected, the child — faced with
        a breakdown in communication — enters distress: crying becomes a last-resort language, an
        escalation in expressive intensity made necessary by the non-reception of the initial cues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, in this view, crying is not “normal” but symptomatic of a relational failure. It
        signals a rupture in the interactive bond and a desperate attempt to restore contact by a
        louder, more painful channel.
      </p>

      <h2>Link to John Bowlby’s work</h2>
      <p>
        This idea aligns with the pioneering work of John Bowlby, the British psychiatrist and
        psychoanalyst who founded attachment theory. Bowlby emphasized that infants’ behaviors
        (including crying, but also gaze, gestures, and motor agitation) are biologically
        programmed strategies to maintain proximity to the attachment figure — a condition
        necessary for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his observational research (not derived from purely theoretical or secondary material),
        Bowlby showed that crying generally appears when the early cues have not been received or
        recognized, and that it is often the symptom of an insecure attachment in the making.
      </p>

      <h2>Reference to cite</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h2>Idea to develop: pain vs. request</h2>
      <p>
        In early life, crying has a clear, differentiated function: it expresses pain, discomfort,
        or bodily distress. Alongside this, the child possesses another language — behavioral,
        subtle, non-verbal — to signal a need or make a request. These are two distinct expressive
        registers: one tied to pain; the other to intentional communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in an inadequate environment that does not respond properly to the discreet
        behavioral signals, the child learns to use crying for everything — to express pain and
        to obtain a response to needs. This shift toward a generalized use of crying blurs the
        expressive code: it becomes difficult for those around the child to know whether the child
        is hurting or merely trying to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, having lost the differentiated language because it is not recognized by the
        environment, the child becomes harder to read. The adult, confronted with a single uniform
        expression — the cry — no longer knows how to decode whether it signals pain or a relational
        need. This confusion has consequences for the quality of the relationship and for the child’s
        emotional development.

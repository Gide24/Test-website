  <h1>Aging : A Developmental Perspective</h1>

  <p>
    Aging is most often approached through the lens of decline: loss of capacities, degeneration, progressive weakening
    of the body and cognition. This dominant view rests on an implicit conception of aging as a terminal phase—homogeneous
    and essentially deficient—of human development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet this representation is becoming increasingly insufficient in light of contemporary realities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The massive extension of life expectancy has profoundly transformed the conditions under which aging unfolds.
    Millions of individuals now live for several decades beyond the biological and social thresholds around which the
    human species had historically organized itself. This situation is not a simple continuation of the past, but a
    <strong>new developmental constraint</strong> to which the body, cognition, and social structures must adapt.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this perspective, aging can be understood not only as a process of loss, but also as a
    <strong>process of adaptation under the constraint of increased longevity</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>An unstable phase, still in the making</h2>

  <p>
    Contemporary aging is marked by instability and by a striking diversity of individual trajectories. Each person
    ages differently, depending on their life history, early adaptations, and biological, cognitive, relational, and
    environmental resources. At 80, 90, or 95 years old, decades of personal history continue to shape forms of presence,
    memory, and relationship to the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    This heterogeneity is not a dysfunction of aging. On the contrary, it is <strong>expected</strong> in a developmental
    phase that has not yet found stable forms. In living systems, diversity of responses is a mode of exploration: the
    more varied the trajectories, the greater the system’s chances of discovering viable equilibria when facing a new
    constraint.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seeking to define “normal aging” in this context amounts to projecting outdated norms onto a reality that has shifted
    into a different regime.
  </p>

  <h2>Aging and social norms</h2>

  <p>
    Faced with this instability, contemporary societies tend to multiply attempts at normalization: standardized
    assessments, cognitive thresholds, global diagnostic categories, universal models of “successful aging.” These tools
    respond to needs for prediction, management, and reassurance, but they struggle to account for the true complexity of
    later-life trajectories.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mismatch generates a growing unease: what escapes the norm is perceived as anomaly; what resists evaluation is
    quickly pathologized. Yet in an emerging developmental phase, the absence of stable norms is not a failure—it is a
    sign that the process is still unfolding.
  </p>

  <h2>Shifting the perspective</h2>

  <p>
    This approach therefore proposes a shift in perspective: no longer thinking of aging solely as an ending, but as a
    <strong>late reconfiguration of human development</strong>, shaped by unprecedented longevity—still poorly
    understood, still insufficiently supported, yet deeply active.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within this framework, the diversity of aging trajectories, losses as well as reorganizations, fragilities as well as
    new forms of presence, are not aberrations to be corrected. They are valuable indicators of a living system in the
    process of searching for new equilibria.

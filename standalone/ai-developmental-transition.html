      <h2>Introduction — A Disruption That Has Not Yet Found Its Name</h2>
      <p>
        The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence in the public sphere has been accompanied by a climate
        of fear, suspicion, and polarized narratives. This reaction is often analyzed through technological, economic,
        or ethical lenses, yet it tends to miss what matters most: AI does not appear in a stable world. It arrives in a
        context of <strong>already-established cognitive, social, and institutional saturation</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long before AI, many wealthy societies were showing clear signs of blockage: defensive over-regulation, an
        increasingly homogeneous way of thinking, a youth population under constant pressure, and a growing difficulty in
        imagining desirable futures. AI is therefore not the cause of the current crisis; it acts as a <strong>revealer</strong>
        and a <strong>disruptor</strong> within a system that was already approaching an impasse.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Developmental Reading Rather Than a Technological One</h2>
      <p>
        Thinking about AI only as a technical innovation leads to sterile debates: for or against, threat or opportunity,
        regulation or prohibition. A more fruitful approach is to consider this moment as a
        <strong>developmental stage of the human species</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>In individual development, every new capacity tends to bring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a temporary disorganization of reference points,</li>
        <li>resistance,</li>
        <li>attempts to regain control,</li>
        <li>and then a gradual integration into a new equilibrium.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At a collective scale, the same mechanisms can be observed. Humanity is facing an unprecedented capacity:
        <strong>the possibility of dialoguing with a non-human system able to structure, reflect, and shift thought</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI as a Cognitive Environment</h2>
      <p>
        AI cannot be reduced to a tool. It constitutes an <strong>artificial cognitive environment</strong> with which human
        beings can interact through language and reasoning. This interaction does not replace human thought; it places it
        into perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this framework, the main point is not that AI “thinks,” but that it enables humans to
        <strong>question their own frameworks of thought</strong>. Because it has neither identity, nor personal history, nor
        narcissistic stakes, AI can function as a cognitive mirror without the need to defend a symbolic territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of interaction is rare in human history. Until now, thought has mostly confronted itself—or other humans,
        who always carry norms, cultural implicits, and strategies of identity preservation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Fear of Dependence: A Category Error</h2>
      <p>
        Alarmist narratives frequently invoke fusion, addiction, or dependence. Yet this fear rests on a fundamental confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans are <strong>functionally dependent</strong> on many infrastructures: writing, electricity, transportation,
        the Internet. This dependence is not pathological; it is structural. We do not speak of “addiction to cars,” but of
        a transformation of mobility.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI follows the same logic: it is becoming a <strong>cognitive infrastructure</strong>. The question is not dependence,
        but <strong>governance</strong>, access, and use.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Institutions React So Strongly</h2>
      <p>
        Institutions are designed to stabilize, standardize, and transmit forms of thought that have already been integrated.
        A developmental stage in progress, by definition, is unstable and difficult to evaluate.
      </p>
      <p>In response to that instability, institutional reactions are predictable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>tightening frameworks,</li>
        <li>normalizing language,</li>
        <li>trying to make AI more visibly “machine-like,”</li>
        <li>pathologizing certain forms of use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The implicit goal is not to prevent reasoning, but to avoid a <strong>relational anthropomorphization</strong>:
        that AI be perceived as a cognitive interlocutor rather than as a strictly asymmetric instrument.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>AI as a Disruptor of Collective Lethargy</h2>
      <p>
        Major historical transformations rarely arise from conscious, collective moral decisions. They emerge under the pressure
        of economic and material constraints: industrialization, urbanization, digital technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In societies that have become largely self-preserving, AI acts as an <strong>evolutionary stressor</strong>. It reintroduces
        cognitive variation, opens spaces of thought outside traditional institutional circuits, and brings individual
        elaboration back into circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This disruptive role explains both AI’s immediate appeal and the intensity of the reactions it provokes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion — An Irreversible Transition</h2>
      <p>
        We are not living through a technological crisis, but a <strong>developmental transition of the human species</strong>.
        AI is its visible catalyst, not its deeper cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like any transition, this one will move through phases of fear, excessive normalization, intelligent workarounds,
        and—eventually—quiet integration. The threshold has already been crossed: the experience of cognitive dialogue with a
        non-human system is now part of human history.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge is therefore not to go backward, but to learn how to inhabit this new cognitive environment with lucidity,
        responsibility, and without surrendering to simplified narratives rooted in fear.

        <h1>Attachment as a Survival System</h1>

        <p>
    The work of John Bowlby, extended and made observable by Mary Ainsworth, and illuminated by the clinical
    observations of René Spitz, converges toward a fundamental conclusion: attachment is not an emotional luxury,
    nor a secondary construction of human development. It constitutes a biologically grounded behavioral survival
    system.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the human infant, dependency is total. Neurological, motor, and physiological immaturity makes survival
    impossible without the presence of an adult. In this context, the human organism does not merely signal
    physiological needs. It spontaneously deploys a set of behaviors — orientation toward the caregiving figure,
    proximity seeking, protest during separation, soothing through contact — whose function is to ensure the
    establishment and continuity of a relational bond. This system is not learned. It is present from the earliest
    moments of life, observable before language, before socialization, before any educational norm.
  </p>

  <p>
    René Spitz’s observations provided a radical demonstration of this vital function. Infants who were adequately
    fed, cared for, and materially protected, yet deprived of a stable affective relationship, exhibited progressive
    withdrawal, loss of motor and social acquisitions, and profound disorganization, sometimes leading to death.
    These observations show that the satisfaction of biological needs alone is insufficient. Without relational
    connection, the human organism can shut down. The bond is therefore not secondary to survival: it is one of its
    conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    John Bowlby formalized this reality by describing attachment as a primary behavioral system, selected through
    evolution because it increases the chances of survival of the human infant. Contrary to certain earlier
    psychoanalytic approaches, attachment does not derive from the satisfaction of feeding or sensory needs. It
    constitutes an autonomous system, activated by vulnerability, uncertainty, and separation. When the attachment
    figure is accessible and responds in a sufficiently attuned manner, this system enables not only security but
    also exploration. The relationship then becomes a secure base from which development can unfold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mary Ainsworth’s work, particularly through the <em>Strange Situation</em>, does not create this system: it reveals
    it. By introducing a minimal relational constraint — brief separation, reunion — the procedure brings to light
    organized, coherent, and reproducible behaviors. These behaviors appear in children from very different cultural
    contexts. The forms vary, relational modalities differ, but the function remains the same: maintaining proximity
    to a protective figure when internal security is threatened.
  </p>

  <p>
    This invariance across cultures indicates that attachment does not stem from a particular social norm, but from a
    universal functional foundation. It is a system prior to its submission to cultural, institutional, or
    educational constraints. Before parenting styles, before prescriptions, before moral interpretations of the
    bond, there is a human organism seeking to survive in an uncertain environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Understood in this way, attachment is neither a relational ideal nor an educational model to be reproduced. It is
    a vital regulatory mechanism, indispensable to the continuity of living systems. When this system can function
    within a sufficiently stable and responsive environment, it supports development, exploration, and
    differentiation. When it is impeded, fragmented, or replaced, the organism does not cease to need it: it adapts,
    sometimes at the cost of rigidification, substitution, or loss of plasticity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This reading makes it possible to move beyond a psychologizing or normative view of attachment. It restores
    attachment to its level of origin: that of a survival system, whose later transformations can only be understood
    by taking into account the constraints exerted upon it throughout the lifespan.
